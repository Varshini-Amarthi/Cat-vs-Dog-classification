This project is created using machine learning modules to classify the images of cat and dog.
It is a deep learning project using the Tensorflow and Keras libraries with the Convolutional Neural Network method.
This development allows us to detect whether the entered image is a cat or a dog.
Cats and dogs are part of the same group at five levels: both are in the domain Eukarya, the kingdom Animalia, the phylum Chordata, the class Mammalia, and the order Carnivora.
The dataset can be used for learning how to develop,evaluate and use convolutional deep learning neural networks for classification of images.
Here i downloaded the dataset from kaggle on-site to save my storage.
And i downloaded one cat image and one dog image to check the dimensions of the images using matplotlib.
And finally predicted the accuracy of the classification using "model.predict()".
